## Key Features

 - **Expense Tracking:** Record and track your expenses with ease. Input the
   amount of money you have, and the app will automatically update your
   balance with each purchase.
 - **Purchase Details:** Capture essential details for each purchase,
   including the name of the store, description of the product, time and
   date of purchase, and amount of money spent.
 - **Cancel and Refund:** If you make a purchase in error or change your

2.  Enter the details of your purchase, including the store name, product description, purchase amount, and any additional notes that you want to include.
    
3.  After entering the details, tap "Save" to record the purchase. The app will automatically update your wallet balance accordingly.

#### Tips for Efficient Usage:
